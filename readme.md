Berikut adalah bagian tambahan README yang mencakup langkah-langkah untuk menambahkan dan menggunakan database PostgreSQL dalam proyek:

Database Setup
This project uses PostgreSQL as the database management system. Follow the steps below to set up the PostgreSQL database:

Installation: If you haven't installed PostgreSQL yet, download and install it from the official PostgreSQL website. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Database Configuration: After installing PostgreSQL, create a database and user for your project. You can use tools like psql or graphical database management tools like pgAdmin to do this. Make sure to take note of the database connection information such as database name, user, password, and host.

Install PostgreSQL Library for Node.js: To interact with the PostgreSQL database from your Node.js backend, you need to install the PostgreSQL library for Node.js. You can use pg library for this purpose.

Configure Database Connection in Backend: Create a configuration file or module that contains the PostgreSQL database connection information. You can store this connection information in environment variables or in a separate configuration file.

```bash
// server/config/db.config.js

const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
  user: 'your_database_user',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'your_database_name',
  password: 'your_database_password',
  port: 5432,
});

module.exports = pool;
```

Migrate Database (optional): you can use migrations to manage your database schema. You can create new migration files and run them to create or update your database schema.

```bash
npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name create_users_table
npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```
